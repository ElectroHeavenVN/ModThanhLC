*__<u>Notes for foreigners who bought the license to use this program:</u>__ Your money has been spent in the wrong place. ThanhLC doesn't deserve the money he made from selling other people's hard work. In fact, many features in this mod were originally made by me and other contributors of the [Dragonboy CommunityMod](https://github.com/pk9r327/Dragonboy/tree/legacy) project.*
